ex:
4 9 2
3 5 7
8 1 6

so:                                                           
R1 >> 4 + 9 + 2 = 15                                                         
R2 >> 3 + 5 + 7 = 15                                                         
R3 >> 8 + 1 + 6 = 15                                                          
C1 >> 4 + 3 + 8 = 15                                                         
C2 >> 9 + 5 + 1 = 15                                                         
C3 >> 2 + 7 + 6 = 15                                                         
D1 >> 4 + 5 + 6 = 15                                                         
D2 >> 8 + 5 + 2 = 15
